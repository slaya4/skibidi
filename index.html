  <h2>How to Switch Health Insurance Plans Without Losing Coverage</h2>
  <p>
    Switching health insurance plans can feel stressful, especially when you rely on continuous coverage
    for doctor visits, prescriptions, or ongoing treatment. Many people delay making changes because they
    worry about coverage gaps or unexpected costs.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the right timing and preparation, it is possible to switch plans smoothly while staying insured
    the entire time. Understanding how enrollment rules work and planning your transition carefully can
    help you avoid common mistakes.
  </p>
  <h3>Understand Enrollment Periods</h3>
  <p>
    Most health insurance changes must be made during an open enrollment period. This is the annual window
    when you can enroll in a new plan or switch existing coverage without restrictions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of open enrollment, you may still qualify for a special enrollment period if you experience
    a major life event such as changing jobs, losing coverage, moving, getting married, or having a child.
    These events usually provide a limited timeframe to choose a new plan.
  </p>
  <h3>Avoid Canceling Your Current Plan Too Early</h3>
  <p>
    One of the most common mistakes is ending your current insurance before the new plan officially starts.
    This can leave you uninsured for days or weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Always confirm the exact start date of your new coverage before canceling the old one. Ideally, your
    new plan should begin immediately after your previous coverage ends to ensure there is no gap.
  </p>
  <h3>Compare Plan Details Carefully</h3>
  <p>
    Monthly premiums are only one part of the cost. Deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket
    maximums all affect how much you will pay over the year.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is also important to check provider networks and prescription coverage. Make sure your doctors,
    hospitals, and medications are included in the new plan to avoid disruptions or higher costs.
  </p>
  <h3>Confirm Coverage Dates</h3>
  <p>
    Coverage dates do not always align automatically. Employer plans, private insurance, and marketplace
    plans all follow different rules for start and end dates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Verify all dates in writing and keep confirmation emails or documents. Having proof of coverage can
    be important if there is ever a dispute about when your insurance was active.
  </p>
  <h3>Review Your New Plan Immediately</h3>
  <p>
    Once your new insurance begins, review the policy details right away. Confirm that your personal
    information is correct and that your providers and prescriptions are listed properly.
  </p>
  <p>
    If something is wrong, contact the insurer as soon as possible. Fixing issues early can prevent denied
    claims and unexpected bills.
  </p>
  <h3>Plan Ahead for Medical Care</h3>
  <p>
    If you have upcoming appointments or treatments, try to schedule them either before your old plan
    ends or after the new one begins. For ongoing care, confirm coverage with both insurers if necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    Planning ahead helps reduce stress and ensures your healthcare needs continue without interruption.
  </p>
  <p>
    By understanding enrollment rules, timing your switch carefully, and reviewing plan details closely,
    you can change health insurance plans with confidence and avoid losing coverage.
